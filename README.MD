1. Understand React and Its Advantages    

a) Write a brief explanation of Reactâ€™s core features: component-based architecture, Virtual DOM, and unidirectional data flow. 

b) Discuss why these features make React ideal for building modern web applications.

2. Set Up a Basic React Environment    

a) Create an HTML file and include CDN links for React and ReactDOM. 

b) Add a "<"div">" with an id of "root" in the HTML body. 

c) Write a simple React component inside a <script> tag and use ReactDOM.render() to render it to the page. 

3. Create and Render Functional Components    

a) Define a functional React component (e.g., GreetingComponent) that returns a simple JSX element. 

b) Render the component using ReactDOM.render() to display it on the page. 

4. Use JSX for Structuring Components
