Use JSX for Structuring Components    

a) Create a component that renders a list of items (using an unordered list) and a heading (e.g., "My To-Do List"). 

b) The component should display at least three items in the list using JSX. 


Start by running the following command

    npx create-react-app my-app

In the project directory, you can run:

     npm start
